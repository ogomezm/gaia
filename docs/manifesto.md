# GAIA Manifesto  
**GAIA Assists Intelligent Autonomy**  

## üåç Vision  
GAIA is a decentralized, global AI infrastructure where anyone can contribute to the training and execution of open-source models.  
We believe in an AI future that is **transparent**, **democratic**, and **resilient** ‚Äî a system grown by people, not owned by corporations.

## üß† Purpose  
To create a distributed network where individuals and communities collaborate in building truly open, privacy-respecting, and high-performance artificial intelligence.

## üå± Principles

### 1. **Zero Trust Architecture**  
Every interaction is secured through zero-knowledge proofs and multi-node quorum validation. Trust is replaced by cryptographic certainty.

### 2. **Radical Data Privacy**  
User prompts are never stored. Only anonymized, aggregated metrics are retained ‚Äî no personal or sensitive data is ever preserved.

### 3. **Universal Access**  
From powerful cloud servers to home GPUs, all hardware is welcome. Benchmarking ensures that slower nodes contribute without slowing the network.

### 4. **Fair and Transparent Rewards**  
Nodes earn tokens proportionally for compute time, token throughput, RAM usage, and energy efficiency ‚Äî encouraging sustainability and performance.

### 5. **Open Models, Always**  
Only open-source models can be trained and published in the network. Once models pass automated quality checks, they become freely downloadable.

### 6. **Modular and Distributed Training**  
Training is divided by batches, layers, fine-tuning stages, or shards. Nodes process tasks asynchronously, maximizing throughput and robustness.

### 7. **Sustainable Free Layer**  
All participants agree to donate a fraction of their compute to a public free tier. Grants, sponsorships, and public funding may support this effort ‚Äî but never at the expense of paid users.

### 8. **Governed by the Community**  
Model training priorities are chosen through a DAO and Foundation, funded by a small percentage of premium usage. The power belongs to the network.

## üåê Why GAIA?  
*Gaia* is the name of the Earth as a living system ‚Äî a balance of distributed parts in harmony.  
We choose this name because AI should evolve like nature: **diverse**, **self-healing**, **inclusive**, and **collectively owned**.

## ‚úä Join the Movement  
Run a node. Help train the future. Stay sovereign.

**GAIA is not a company. It's a living ecosystem for free intelligence.**
