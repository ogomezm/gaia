# GAIA: Decentralized, Trustless, and Resilient AI

## Manifesto

We, the contributors to the GAIA project, believe in a future where artificial intelligence is free, open, and governed by the many—not the few. GAIA is a response to the increasing centralization of AI, where knowledge, data, and compute are owned by corporate and governmental oligopolies. Our mission is to democratize the training, hosting, and usage of large AI models using a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving, and trustless architecture.

## Overview

GAIA (General Autonomy through Integrated Agents) is a decentralized infrastructure for training and inference of open source AI models. It connects individual contributors—each providing compute, memory, and storage—to a distributed system that learns collectively and distributes knowledge back to the commons.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Open Access**: All models trained by the network are open source and downloadable.
2. **Privacy First**: No private data is stored or logged. Only anonymized, aggregated statistics are retained.
3. **Zero Trust**: Each node is sandboxed using secure technologies (e.g., Docker, WASM), with cryptographic verification (zk-proofs) for every contribution.
4. **Fair Participation**: Every node is rewarded proportionally based on its effective contribution: time, compute, energy efficiency, and reliability.
5. **Decentralized Governance**: A DAO decides which models to train, governs reward distributions, and oversees quality assurance.

## System Architecture

### Node Requirements

* Low barrier of entry: a home PC with a GPU is sufficient.
* Optional: high-performance setups are welcome.
* Nodes can contribute to:

  * Training (by batches, layers, fine-tuning, or shards)
  * Inference (responding to user prompts)
  * Storage (model sharing, checkpoints, parameters)

### Work Distribution

* Nodes are benchmarked and assigned tasks accordingly.
* Lightweight nodes handle inference or partial training.
* Heavy nodes process full batches, shard recombination, or complex prompts.
* zk-proofs and quorum validation ensure all contributions are verifiable.

## Privacy and Security

* Enclaves (Docker/WASM) isolate execution.
* zk-SNARKs verify computations without exposing data.
* Aggregation layers anonymize all logs.
* Prompt content is never stored.

## Reward Model

* Rewards are issued per unit of work:

  * **Compute Time**
  * **Tokens Processed**
  * **Memory Usage**
  * **Energy Efficiency** (tokens per watt)
* Nodes are scored by uptime, responsiveness, and audit results.
* Bonuses are given for:

  * Lower energy usage per token
  * Consistent availability
  * Fast response time

## Tokenomics

GAIA operates with a utility token designed to reward contributors fairly, ensure long-term sustainability, and resist speculative volatility. The key principles of GAIA's tokenomics are:

### 1. Stability and Anti-Volatility Design

* The GAIA token is **pegged to a basket of inflation-indexed values**, ensuring its purchasing power remains stable over time.
* The token's value growth will be **tied to official inflation metrics**, providing consistency for contributors who rely on predictable compensation.

### 2. Fair Reward Distribution

* Nodes are rewarded in proportion to:

  * Compute time
  * Token throughput
  * Memory usage
  * Energy efficiency (tokens per watt)
  * Uptime and availability
* **Stable, low-volatility token value** ensures the contributor's investment (hardware, time, energy) maintains value.

### 3. Incentives for Network Diversity

* **Rewards are higher for new nodes** joining the network to incentivize decentralization.
* **Penalty or diminishing returns** for entities running large-scale, centralized clusters to avoid dominance.
* **Geographic diversity rewards** for nodes in underrepresented regions.

### 4. Anti-Speculation Mechanisms

* The token cannot be used for high-frequency trading.
* Lockup periods apply for large holders.
* Smart contracts limit price swings via controlled liquidity pools.

### 5. DAO and Treasury

* A portion of all rewards funds the GAIA DAO and Foundation:

  * DAO: decides which models to prioritize.
  * Foundation: funds open science, node onboarding, and education.
  * R\&D: grants to developers improving the network.

## Governance

* DAO based on quadratic voting.
* Any community member can propose models, architectures, or training goals.
* Smart contracts ensure that no single entity dominates decision-making.

## Quality Control

* Models must pass:

  * Accuracy benchmarks
  * Robustness tests
  * Bias and fairness audits
* Only verified models are published and made downloadable.

## Supported Frameworks (initial)

* PyTorch
* Hugging Face Transformers
* TensorFlow
* ONNX (for cross-platform compatibility)

## Funding the Free Tier

* Every node contributes a small part of their compute to support the free tier.
* Optional donations, sponsorships, and public grants fund additional capacity.
* **Premium tier** does not subsidize the free tier and remains financially independent.

## Future Work

* Mobile and edge-node support
* Federated fine-tuning
* Trustless distributed training at scale
* Hardware co-design (Open Source GPUs)
